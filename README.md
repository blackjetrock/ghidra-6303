# ghidra-6303
Ghidra 6303 support and 6303 projects
=====================================

There is support for the 6303 processor (as used in Psion organisers as well as other devices) in this repository. Put the 6303 directory into your Ghidra/Processors directory and the 6303 support should appear when setting up a new project. The 'extra' 6303 instructions appear in the disassembly but I haven't added the procedural part so no decompilation will appear.

Psion Organiser
===============

The reason for doing this was to get a disassembly of Psion Organiser code going. There is a Ghidra project here that is a start of the work to disassemble Psion organiser things, starting with the 33-LA ROM. I started with this ROM as it doesn't have bank switching so is an easier ROM to start on.

Flash driver
============

It would also be usedful to have some idea of what the flash driver does, so the V1.9 driver OPK is also here.
